        <firstletter>S</firstletter>anta Maria del Fiore was built on the site of Florence's second cathedral dedicated to Saint Reparta;
        the first was Basillica di San Lorenzo di Firenze, the first building of which was consecrated as a church in 393 by St. 
        Ambrose of Milan.</p>
       
 <p>The ancient structure, founded in the early 5th century and having undergone many repairs,
        was crumbling with age. according to the 14th-century Nuova Cronica of Giovanni Villani and 
        was no longer large enough to serve the growing population of the city.
         Other major Tuscan cities had undertaken ambitious reconstructions of their cathedrals during the Late Medieval period, 
         such as Pisa and particularly Siena where the enormous proposed extensions were never completed.
    </p>
    <p>The cathedral of Florence is built as a basilica, having a wide central nave of four square bays, with an aisle on
        either side. The chancel and transepts are of identical polygonal plan, separated by two smaller polygonal chapels.</p>
    <p>The whole plan forms a Latin cross. The nave and aisles are separated by wide pointed Gothic arches resting on composite piers. The dimensions of the building are enormous: building area 8,300 square metres (89,340 square feet), length 153 metres (502 feet), width 38 metres (125 feet), width at the crossing 90 metres (300 feet).

    <p>Piazza della Signoria is an L-shaped square in front of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, Italy. It was named after the Palazzo della Signoria, also called Palazzo Vecchio. It is the main point of the origin and history of the Florentine Republic and still maintains its reputation as the political focus of the city. It is the meeting place of Florentines as well as the numerous tourists, located near Palazzo Vecchio and Piazza del Duomo and gateway to Uffizi Gallery.</p>
        <p>The impressive 14th-century Palazzo Vecchio is still preeminent with its crenellated tower. The square is also shared with the Loggia della Signoria, the Uffizi Gallery, the Palace of the Tribunale della Mercanzia (1359) (now the Bureau of Agriculture), and the Palazzo Uguccioni (1550. with a facade attributed to Raphael, who however died thirty years before its construction).
